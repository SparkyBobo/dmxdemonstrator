# Ordering PCBs

## OHS Park

All boards for this projects can be ordered from [OHS Park](https://oshpark.com/). The offer a project sharing features that make is easy to upload a Kicad board and share the link so others can order them. I include them are the default PCB supplier because of this functionality.  OHS Park sells boards in packs of 3 so you will have more boards than you need unless you are building multiples.

## Quality vs Price

OHSPark offers really great quality at great prices, they are easy to work with, manufacture 100% in the US, and their support is excellent. I use OHSPark for almost everything I build, expect when the cost is super high. Lower cost boards can be had but if you spec the same quality board OHSPark offers at those places, you will find OHSPark to be very competitive but this project can easily use a cheaper quality PCB than what OHS Park offers. The links above are for the more expensive OHSPark board for the reason I listed above plus; they make it so easy to order for a project like this it's silly not to use them.

I offer this opinion freely and do not receive any compensation from OHSPark.

## Alternate suppliers

There are many different places to get a PCB made, and many of them are cheaper than OHS Park because the boards are lower quality, which works fine in this application. However, uploading the board design is more complicated.  While OHS Park takes the `.kicak_pcb` file directly, other places require a set of [Gerber files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format). Kicad can easily create Gerbers and many board houses even supply the instructions for exporting Gerbers they can consume. I consider these instructions to be outside the scope of this project but feel free to export Gerbers and order cheaper boards if you like. You can do a web search for "kicad create gerbers 5.0" to find the places that offer instructions. Read the board options carefully because many still make boards with lead and/or include additional text on the board for thier logistics.
