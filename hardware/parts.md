# Ordering Parts

## Namebrand vs Generic

Like just about everything else, electronic parts come in both namebrand and generic. A great example is the Bourns [3299 potentiometer series](https://www.bourns.com/docs/Product-Datasheets/3299.pdf). These parts are brandname and because they are so popular, many other companies will offer very similar parts, sometimes identical, under different brands and prices. Even parts from a specific brandname become so popular, you can find (nearly) identical parts from other brandnames as well. A good example of this is the [555 timer](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne555.pdf). There are many different variations of this part made by different brandnames and they all tend to be compatible.

The parts required for this project do not require strict selection and most generic parts will work in place of the namebrand parts. I specify the namebrand parts because:

- They offer excellent selection and documentation. 
- I used them during prototyping to make sure what I spec'ed will work for you.

In some cases, I didn't specify a namebrand part because the generics are so prolific, such as LEDs and 1/4w resistors.

## Sparkfun and Adafruit

Both Sparkfun and Adafruit are electronic parts suppliers and a whole lot more. They invest heavily in the DIY and OpenSource communities and offers tons of parts, tutorials, and open source software. They also offer great wishlist functionlaity for grouping parts together.

Wherever possible, I provide part numbers and links to the parts these two great companies supply. IMO, they deserve your support for making projects like this possible and easy. Sparkfuyn is West Coast and Adafruit is East Coast if [East Coast vs West Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast%E2%80%93West_Coast_hip_hop_rivalry) is your jam.

I offer this opinion freely and do not receive any compensation from Sparkfun or Adafruit.

## Digikey and Mouser

Both Mouser and Mouser are also electronic parts suppliers that support the DIY and OpenSource communities. It's super easy to get a large selection of parts in [onesie-twosie](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/onesie-twosie) so I provide part numbers and links to the parts these two great companies supply as well when the parts become more specific. 

I offer this opinion freely and do not receive any compensation from Digikey and Mouser.

## Octopart and other options

There are other great companies out there as well so do what works for you. [Octopart](https://octopart.com/) is an excellent resource for tracking down specific parts at the lowest prices.

One more shoutout to a company I like a lot: [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/). They have been around a long time and offer a wide slection of both namebranch and generic parts. I have not listed any of their parts directly to cut down on expenses and part verification but you can find a lot of great deals there as well.
